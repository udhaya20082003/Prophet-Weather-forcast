# Prophet Weather Forecast Model

This repository contains a weather forecasting model built using **Prophet**, a tool developed by Facebook for time series forecasting. The model is designed to predict weather conditions such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, or other relevant weather parameters based on historical data.

## Features

- **Forecasting Weather**: The model predicts future weather patterns based on past observations.
- **Customizable**: Can be easily adapted to different weather parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall) by adjusting input data.
- **Forecast Horizon**: Can generate forecasts for any given period (days, weeks, months).
- **Easy Integration**: Built using Python, the model can be integrated with other weather prediction systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Required libraries:
  - `prophet`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
